# 2.tiles

As the title says, I wanted to work with some tiles. My idea in this project is to create a digital clock design. This is how it looks:

</p>

The clock starts at ```00:00``` and keeps adding 1 second. The exact timing wasn't my concern, therefore the timer may be slower than an actual clock. Remember, this is just a demonstration of manipulating tiles.

I wrote a basic [tilemap generator](https://notimplementedlife.github.io/Gameboy-ASM-Examples/misc/TilemapGenerator/index.html "Tilemap Generator") in HTML which can be found in this repo. Just design your own tilemap, press ```Encode```, and then use the generated code in your assembly file.
